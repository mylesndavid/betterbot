- [ ] Skill/tool marketplace
- [ ] Multi-platform (Windows, Linux)
- [ ] Mobile companion app (iOS/Android)

## BetterBot Cloud
Fully hosted platform — no install, no API keys, no terminal. Sign up, connect your vault (or use a hosted one), your agent just runs. Always-on heartbeat, web panel, Telegram/Slack, all managed.

- [ ] Cloud gateway — agent runs on our infra, vault syncs via Obsidian Sync or S3
- [ ] Onboarding wizard — name your agent, pick a personality, connect integrations
- [ ] Web-only vault option — for people who don't use Obsidian
- [ ] Usage-based pricing — pay per agent activity, not flat subscription
- [ ] Team/org support — shared agents, shared tools, shared context
- [ ] SOC 2 / data privacy — credentials never leave the user's encrypted store

## Business
- [ ] Open-source core (AGPL or BSL)
- [ ] Three tiers: free self-hosted, paid DMG app, BetterBot Cloud
- [ ] Pro features — multi-device sync, priority model routing, advanced integrations
- [ ] Hardware product with margins
- [ ] Build in public — demos, devlogs, prototypes
